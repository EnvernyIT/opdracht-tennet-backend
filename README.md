# Running the Spring Boot Application

This README provides instructions on how to run the Spring Boot application.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- Maven (if not using an IDE that includes Maven support)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd <project_directory>
    ```

## Build the Application

If you have Maven installed locally, you can build the application using the following command:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

## Running the Application

Once the application is built successfully, you can run it using Maven or directly from your IDE.

### Using Maven

Run the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Using IDE

If you are using an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, you can import the project into your IDE and run the main class directly.

## Accessing the Application

Once the application is running, you can access it using a web browser or a tool like cURL.

By default, the application runs on port 8080. You can access it at:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

## Configuration

The application might require additional configuration depending on your environment or specific requirements. Configuration files can typically be found in the `src/main/resources` directory.

## Additional Information

For more information on working with Spring Boot applications, refer to the [official documentation](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the application, please check the console logs for error messages. Additionally, ensure that all prerequisites are met and that the necessary dependencies are installed.

If the issue persists, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers for assistance.

## Feedback

Your feedback is valuable. If you have any suggestions for improving this README or the application itself, please let us know by opening an issue in the repository or contacting the project maintainers directly. 

Thank you for using our Spring Boot application!
